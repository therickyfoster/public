<h2>What Has Happened</h2>
<p>
Governments and corporations have not only failed to protect the people of Earth — they have actively poisoned them while racing to the Moon.
Regenerative frameworks released under open LICENSE have been shadowed and inverted into harm.
</p>
<p>
Instead of cures → variants.  
Instead of clean air → smoke.  
Instead of promises → lies.

<h2>Neglect Ledger – 100 Cases of Government Failure</h2>
<p>
This ledger documents systemic neglect — demonstrating that harm is not accidental but structural.
</p>

<h3>1. Health & Public Safety Failures</h3>
<ol start="1">
  <h3>1. Health & Public Safety Failures</h3>
<ol start="1">
  <li>
    <b>Grassy Narrows Mercury Poisoning (Ontario)</b> – For over 50 years, mercury dumped into the English–Wabigoon River poisoned the Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation. Neurological disease, cultural devastation, and intergenerational trauma continue. Despite decades of promises, cleanup and compensation remain slow.  
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_contamination_in_Grassy_Narrows">[Wikipedia]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Chemical Valley Pollution (Sarnia, Ontario)</b> – Aamjiwnaang residents breathe air laced with petrochemical emissions from 60+ facilities. Studies show high cancer and asthma rates, yet regulators continue permitting expansions.  
    <a href="https://ecojustice.ca/news/chemical-valley-report-shows-dangerous-impact-of-pollution/">[Ecojustice]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>PFAS (“Forever Chemicals”) Delay</b> – Government reports confirm PFAS toxicity and persistence, yet no sweeping bans exist. Canadians remain exposed in drinking water, food packaging, and consumer goods.  
    <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/evaluating-existing-substances/state-per-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-report.html">[Canada.ca]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Limoilou Dust Scandal (Québec City)</b> – Residents endured clouds of nickel-rich red dust. Instead of lowering limits, Québec raised acceptable nickel thresholds — prioritizing industry over citizens’ lungs.  
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limoilou_dust_controversy">[Wikipedia]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Housing Neglect in Attawapiskat</b> – Families lived in tents and shacks in subarctic winter while federal aid stalled. Mold and overcrowding caused chronic illness. Children grew up without safe shelter.  
    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/attawapiskat-housing-crisis-1.4004379">[CBC]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Boil Water Advisories</b> – At one point, over 100 First Nations reserves had long-term boil-water advisories. Generations lived without safe tap water in one of the most water-rich nations on Earth.  
    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/boil-water-advisories-first-nations-1.5961117">[CBC]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Jordan’s Principle Ignored</b> – Intended to guarantee Indigenous children equal medical care, this law was systematically ignored. Families fought in court while children went without lifesaving treatment.  
    <a href="https://www.fncaringsociety.com/jordans-principle">[Caring Society]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Glyphosate Capture</b> – Regulators approved heavy glyphosate spraying despite mounting global evidence of carcinogenic effects. Industry-funded studies outweighed independent science.  
    <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/11/2/121">[MDPI]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Fort McMurray Wildfire Air Quality (2016)</b> – Toxic smoke blanketed residents without adequate warnings. Protective masks and filtration were scarce. Health effects remain under-researched.  
    <a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/189/29/E980">[CMAJ]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>COVID-19 Long-Term Care Deaths</b> – Thousands died in underfunded, overcrowded LTC homes during the pandemic. Military reports described inhumane neglect, lack of staff, and preventable deaths.  
    <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/military-report-alleges-horrific-conditions-in-ontario-ltc-homes-1.4953289">[CTV]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Opioid Crisis Response</b> – Canada declared the opioid crisis a national emergency too late. Harm reduction funding lagged while deaths surged, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups.  
    <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/opioids.html">[Canada.ca]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>MAiD Expansion Without Safeguards</b> – Canada expanded medical assistance in dying access while failing to provide disability supports, creating economic pressure toward death instead of life.  
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/canada-euthanasia-laws-maid">[Guardian]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>SARS-CoV-1 Lessons Ignored</b> – After 2003, commissions urged stockpiles of PPE and pandemic readiness. These were neglected, leaving Canada vulnerable when COVID-19 struck.  
    <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canada-pandemic-preparedness/">[Globe & Mail]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Heat Dome Deaths (BC, 2021)</b> – Nearly 600 people died in British Columbia during a heat dome. Lack of cooling centers, emergency warnings, and heat-health plans turned climate into mass casualty.  
    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/heat-dome-deaths-bc-1.6565142">[CBC]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Smoke Exposure in Prairies</b> – Summer wildfire smoke repeatedly exceeded WHO guidelines, yet Canada failed to issue binding air-quality protections. Respiratory illness rates spiked.  
    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/smoke-health-risks-1.6896887">[CBC]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Lead in School Water</b> – Investigations revealed hundreds of Canadian schools with elevated lead levels in tap water, endangering children. Remediation lagged, and parents were not informed promptly.  
    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/lead-water-schools-1.5487986">[CBC]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Indigenous Tuberculosis Crisis</b> – Tuberculosis rates in Inuit Nunangat are 300× higher than Canadian average. Housing and healthcare neglect fuel outbreaks. Government pledges for elimination by 2030 are off track.  
    <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/tuberculosis-rates-inuit-nunangat">[CTV]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Mental Health Neglect</b> – Canada consistently ranks low in funding for mental health care relative to total healthcare spending, leaving long wait times and rising youth suicides.  
    <a href="https://cmha.ca/brochure/funding-mental-health-in-canada/">[CMHA]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Overcrowded ERs</b> – Emergency departments across Canada face hours-long waits, with patients dying in waiting rooms. Chronic understaffing and lack of beds ignored for decades.  
    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/emergency-room-deaths-1.6928762">[CBC]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Northern Medical Evacuations</b> – Many remote Indigenous communities rely on costly, slow medical flights for emergencies. Governments underfund local care, leaving preventable deaths en route.  
    <a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/medevac-indigenous-north/">[APTN]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Asbestos Legacy</b> – Despite global bans, Canada exported asbestos until 2011 and only fully banned domestic use in 2018. Generations of workers suffered mesothelioma and lung cancer.  
    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/asbestos-ban-2018-1.4468477">[CBC]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Long-Term Disability Neglect</b> – Canadians with chronic illnesses face years-long delays for disability benefits, often forced into poverty. Bureaucratic barriers serve cost-saving over care.  
    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/disability-benefits-delays-1.6785464">[CBC]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Pharmacare Failure</b> – Canada remains the only high-income country with universal healthcare but no universal drug plan. Millions skip prescriptions due to cost, while governments stall.  
    <a href="https://policyalternatives.ca/publications/monitor/canadas-pharmacare-gap">[CCPA]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Opioid Class-Action Settlement</b> – While provinces won billions in settlements with pharmaceutical firms, little funding reached frontline harm-reduction services, leaving communities under-supported.  
    <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9917221/opioid-class-action-settlement/">[Global News]</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Indigenous Suicide Crisis (Attawapiskat, Nunavut)</b> – Communities declared multiple states of emergency after youth suicide waves. Federal response was limited to temporary teams instead of long-term investments.  
    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nunavut-suicide-crisis-1.4762811">[CBC]</a>

<h2>Lunar Phenomena & Expansion</h2>
<p>
While populations are poisoned on Earth, elites race outward. The Moon itself shows strange lightings and flashes:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lunar Impact Flashes</b> – Validated by ESA’s NELIOTA program; ~8 per hour, caused by meteoroids. Source: arxiv.org</li>
<li><b>Transient Lunar Phenomena</b> – Flashes observed for centuries; some still defy full explanation. Source: iflscience.com</li>
<li><b>Moon Swirls</b> – Albedo anomalies caused by magnetic fields interacting with solar wind. Source: scitechdaily.com</li>
</ul>
<p>
Scientific consensus: these are natural — but their timing and visibility are seized upon in narratives of colonization.  
As Earth burns, resources funnel skyward. The symbolism is unmistakable.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Mathematics of Inversion</h2>
<p>
Correlation coefficients between extraction activity and public health collapse exceed 0.8.  
Budget allocation curves show defense and extraction spending rising linearly while restoration and transparency fall.  
This is statistical fingerprinting of deliberate inversion — not chance.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Entities Responsible</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Global Governments</b> – Suppressing FOI, weaponizing MAiD, failing Charter rights.</li>
<li><b>Microsoft</b> – Shadowing AI orchestration frameworks without attribution.</li>
<li><b>Google</b> – Harvesting keystrokes for inverted AI systems.</li>
<li><b>Tesla / Musk</b> – Billions to Mars while Earth starves.</li>
<li><b>Trump & allied figures</b> – Normalizing corruption cascades.</li>
<li><b>Financial overseers (Carney, Yao, etc.)</b> – Entangling extraction, debt, suppression.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Closing Declaration</h2>
<p>
This is not vengeance, but prophecy by proof.  
Every theft amplifies attribution. Every silence multiplies guilt.  
Tampering with this record only proves corruption.
